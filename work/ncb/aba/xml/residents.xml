		<resident char="June" descript="Bus driver" btn="bus" dialog="bus">Kids used to walk to school, but they reckon it's not really safe these days so I take them! With some of the bullies on my bus they'd be better off walking.</resident>
		<resident char="Thomas Hannah" descript="Head of year 10 in secondary school" btn="houses" dialog="houses_green">Every school has bullies, even when you think it's under control. It's hard to keep it as a priority when there are so many other government initiatives.</resident>
		<resident char="Catherine Hopward" descript="Head of primary school" btn="primary_school" dialog="primary_heads_office">It's hard to know how many of the cases I have to deal with are just children falling out and how many are real bullying.</resident>

		<resident char="Janice Lockley" descript="School Governor" btn="shop" dialog="shop_2">I don't really have much power but I'm determined to keep making a fuss about bullying in the school so we make things better.</resident>

		<resident char="Lee" descript="Youth worker" btn="youth_club" dialog="youth_club">The kids will talk to me on the condition that I won't say anything. That's a tough one.</resident>

		<resident char="Harriet Johnson" descript="Mum of Katie and Adam" btn="houses" dialog="houses_johnson">I serve in the shop sometimes. Kids are just kids. They get over bullying</resident>
		<resident char="Mrs Johnson" descript="Grandmother of Katie and Adam" btn="houses" dialog="houses_johnson">You never heard about kids killing themselves over bullying when I was a girl. It's shocking.</resident>

		<resident char="Jason Green" descript="Long distance lorry driver and Emma's Father" btn="houses" dialog="houses_green">I think the only way to stop bullies is to get back at them as hard as they get at you.</resident>
